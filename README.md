# Code Refactor Starter Code
The purpose of this project was to take the example code given and essentially make it better.  We were asked to improve the flow of both the html and css documents and to combine or remove any 
portions of the code that were not necessary.  Throughout this process git pushes to the designated repo were essential as well as the comments included on each push.  Each push was asked to have a 
descriptive comment on what was done since the last push.
